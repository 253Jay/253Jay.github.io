Why I decided to learn software development is that I have wanted to learn how to code for about five years now. I have just been busy with work and life, but I am ready to get my career started now!! I have always been very interested in computers and web pages and how they are made and can operate so smoothly. But I would also like to know how or why something isnt working how it should and how to fix it! I am very excited to start learning!!
